# AL_F
System ready, alienated Artificial Intelligence command center. The language syntax is similar to C++, although it is a custom language operating as a interpretation mechanism for a highly complex artificial intelligence from a supposed planetary constellation approximated 50 light years from our solar system. To understand the systematic representation of the core integration of the code is interpretative to the command sequence of plain-text to computer Kernel Grade Assembly debugging of changes to the computer system. The code it self is not compatible with current system, yet is achieved change in the registers behind the scenes of the Graphical User Interface, as it is with in the Verbose consistence of the main frame of a computer record.  Each command starts with AL_FIN as follows (__WHAT2FIND__)::__PLAINTEXT__::__CLASSINHEIRANCE__; So a command such as a desire to inject a CMD prompt into a foreign computer system as follows  AL_FIN(__WORKSTATIONNAME__)::__INJECT__@(cmd.exe) -^ __LOCALIZEDHOST__#[%HOST%];  So as presented this command is suppose to find the workstation which is the name of the computer system than as follows the host is into a localized host pool that is part of GLOBALHOST domain.
